Background

The main challenge in image classification is recognizing objects from different perspectives.
With the development of technology, deep learning models can be used to automatically classify visual objects.
Why Use CNN?
CNN is very efficient for image recognition tasks.
CNN can learn from patterns in images such as edges, shapes, and more complex patterns

purpose

Building a deep learning model that can recognize images of rock, scissors, and paper.
Training the model to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.
Using early stopping techniques to avoid overfitting.
